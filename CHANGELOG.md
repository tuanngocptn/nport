# Changelog

All notable changes to NPort will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [2.1.5] - 2026-03-31

### Fixed
- 🛡️ **EPERM Error After sudo Install**: Fixed "EPERM: operation not permitted" error when running `nport` after global install with `sudo npm i -g nport`
  - When the binary is downloaded as root, it's owned by `root:root` and non-root users cannot `chmod` it on subsequent runs
  - `setExecutablePermissions()` now checks if the file is already executable (`fs.accessSync X_OK`) before attempting `chmod`
  - If chmod fails with `EPERM`/`EACCES` on a non-executable file, a user-friendly warning is shown instead of crashing
  - Users who installed with `sudo` can now run `nport` normally without manual `chmod`

### Technical Details
- **`setExecutablePermissions()` logic**:
  1. Try `fs.accessSync(path, X_OK)` — if it succeeds, the file is already executable; return immediately (no chmod)
  2. Try `fs.chmodSync(path, '755')` — if it succeeds, done
  3. If chmod fails with `EPERM`/`EACCES`, log a warning but don't crash; the binary was installed with sudo and should still be functional

### Migration
- No action needed — existing installs are unaffected
- Users who hit the EPERM error on v2.1.4 can simply upgrade; the fix is applied on first run

### Changed
- **Defense-in-depth updated**: Permission checks are now 5 layers:
  1. Postinstall: downloads binary and sets `chmod 755` (as installing user or root)
  2. `ensureCloudflared()`: calls `setExecutablePermissions()` on every startup
  3. `setExecutablePermissions()`: skips chmod if already executable; warns but doesn't crash on EPERM
  4. `BinaryManager.validate()`: checks `X_OK` access, auto-fixes with chmod
  5. `BinaryManager.handleError()`: shows troubleshooting tips + cleans up tunnel

## [2.1.4] - 2026-03-16

### Fixed
- 🐧 **Linux EACCES Spawn Error**: Fixed "spawn cloudflared EACCES" permission denied error on Linux
  - Binary now always has execute permissions verified and auto-repaired before spawning
  - `ensureCloudflared()` is called on every run, not just when the binary is missing
  - `BinaryManager.validate()` now checks execute permissions (`X_OK`), not just file existence
  - Auto-fixes permissions with `chmod 755` if the binary exists but isn't executable
  - Shows clear manual fix command (`chmod +x <path>`) if auto-repair fails
- 🔧 **Postinstall Binary Download**: Fixed binary not being downloaded during `npm install`
  - Postinstall script now explicitly calls `ensureCloudflared()` instead of relying on module-level guard that didn't trigger during install
  - Errors during postinstall are now logged as warnings instead of being silently swallowed
  - Users are informed the binary will be downloaded on first run if postinstall fails

### Improved
- 🧹 **Orphaned Tunnel Cleanup**: Spawn failures now trigger automatic tunnel cleanup
  - Previously, if cloudflared failed to start after tunnel creation, the tunnel was left orphaned on the backend
  - Now calls `TunnelOrchestrator.cleanup()` on fatal spawn errors to delete the tunnel
- 💡 **Linux/macOS Error Guidance**: Added EACCES-specific troubleshooting tips
  - Detects permission denied errors on Unix systems
  - Provides actionable steps: `chmod +x` command and reinstall instructions
  - Matches the existing Windows-specific error guidance

### Technical Details
- **Defense-in-depth**: Permission issues are caught at 4 layers:
  1. Postinstall: downloads binary and sets `chmod 755`
  2. `ensureCloudflared()`: runs on every startup, re-applies permissions
  3. `BinaryManager.validate()`: checks `X_OK` access, auto-fixes with chmod
  4. `BinaryManager.handleError()`: shows troubleshooting tips + cleans up tunnel
- **`BinaryManager.attachHandlers()`**: New `onFatalError` callback parameter for spawn error recovery

## [2.1.3] - 2026-01-29

### Fixed
- 🪟 **Windows Spawn Error**: Fixed "spawn UNKNOWN" error on Windows
  - Added Windows-specific spawn options (`windowsHide`, `shell`, `stdio`)
  - Process now spawns correctly with proper path resolution on Windows
  - Added helpful troubleshooting tips for Windows users when spawn fails

### Improved
- 🔧 **Better Windows Error Guidance**: Enhanced error messages for Windows users
  - Detects common spawn errors (UNKNOWN, ENOENT)
  - Provides actionable troubleshooting steps:
    - Check Windows Defender/antivirus blocking
    - Try running as Administrator
    - Reinstall nport if needed

## [2.1.2] - 2026-01-28

### Fixed
- 📊 **Analytics Integration**: Fixed GA4 Measurement Protocol implementation
  - Created dedicated CLI analytics stream (`G-JJHG4DP1K9`) separate from website
  - Fixed `session_id` format (now uses numeric timestamp as required by GA4)
  - Fixed `engagement_time_msec` to use actual number instead of string
  - Added `timestamp_micros` for accurate event timing
  - Removed debug endpoint that was preventing events from being recorded
  - Added proper debug logging when `NPORT_DEBUG=true`

### Changed
- 📦 **Optimized Bundle Size**: Switched from `tsc` to `esbuild` for significantly smaller package
  - New `scripts/build.js` bundles and minifies CLI into single file
  - Tree-shaking removes unused code
  - Disabled TypeScript declaration and source map generation
  - Reduced files in npm package (only `postinstall.js` script included)
- ⚡ **Faster Development**: Improved watch mode with esbuild
  - Minification disabled during development for faster rebuilds

  - Better console output showing active file monitoring

### Improved
- 🧪 **Enhanced Smoke Tests**: Better npm package validation in CI
  - Tests now simulate full npm pack/install flow
  - Installation tested from generated tarball
  - More accurate pre-publish validation

### Technical Details
- **esbuild Configuration**: 
  - Target: Node.js 20
  - Format: ESM
  - External dependencies: `axios`, `chalk`, `ora` (avoids CJS/ESM issues)
  - Shebang added via esbuild banner instead of source file
- **tsconfig.json**: Updated with `noEmit: true`, esbuild handles output
- **Package Size**: Significantly reduced dist folder size
- **Analytics Events**: `cli_start`, `tunnel_created`, `tunnel_error`, `tunnel_shutdown`, `update_available`

### User Experience
**Before:**
```
[Cloudflared] 2026-01-14T04:33:02Z ERR failed to accept QUIC stream...
[Cloudflared] 2026-01-14T04:33:03Z ERR failed to accept QUIC stream...
[Cloudflared] 2026-01-14T04:33:04Z ERR failed to accept QUIC stream...
[Cloudflared] 2026-01-14T04:33:05Z ERR failed to accept QUIC stream...
```

**After:**
```
✔ [1/2] Connection established...
✔ [2/2] Compression enabled...

⚠️  NETWORK CONNECTIVITY ISSUE DETECTED
   Cloudflared is having trouble maintaining a stable connection...
   📡 Your tunnel is still working, but connection quality may be affected.
   
   💡 Possible reasons:
      • Unstable internet connection or high packet loss
      • Firewall/Router blocking UDP traffic (QUIC protocol)
      • ISP throttling or network congestion
      
   🔧 What to try:
      • Check your internet connection stability
      • Try connecting from a different network
      • Disable VPN/Proxy if you're using one
      
   ℹ️  This is usually not critical - your tunnel should continue working normally.
